#Font Looper
Font Looper is a tool for making it easier to work with css icon fonts.
It gives you a page showing how an icon font relates to the characters available, using a character map.

## Instructions
1. Copy the folder 'font-looper' to somewhere you can run php
2. Copy the _folder_ containing your font to the directory, 'fonts'
3. Visit the location of 'font-looper' in your browser
4. By default, the first font found will be represented using a parameter map.

## Limitations
1. You need to have php running
2. The folders for fonts must follow a strict hierarchy
3. Characters are restricted to the first 256 characters in the ASCII range

## Is this finished?
No, it needs to do a lot more before I could call it complete
